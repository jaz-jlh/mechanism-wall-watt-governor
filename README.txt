Hey guys! Looks like you've inherited the project that we didn't finish. Congrats! Honestly, if you are on the software team, you’re in luck. The software is done. Here's the deal; we developed a series of modes that the user will step through to learn about the watt centrifugal governor. Our logic for how the modes will be organized can be seen on the Modes Whiteboard Plan.jpeg. We also created slides that will go on the VGA screen and explain what is happening in each mode. Those can be found in the VGA Slides folder within the Watt Centrifugal Governor folder. The most important part of the software that remains is to wait for the physical governor to be built, so that you can experimentally find the correct values for the Duty cycles to ensure that the two motors (which are different models) spin at the appropriate speeds based on the mode. This should be done in the constants section of the Governor Control.spin file. This code should handle all of the actions that the modes require appropriately and should be loaded into the EEPROM of the teams Prop Mini when completed. A note: there seems to be something weird going on with the electronics in the back of the mechanism board. There is a LOT going on back there and a lot of people are touching and moving a lot of the wires and power supplies. Sometimes, the Prop Mini will just stop outputting information altogether and everything on the governor will shut down for a short period of time. It has always turned back on after a few seconds though. This is a problem that we don’t really know how to fix, it will probably be resolved when the wall is completed and all the electronics are cleaned up. Good luck with the project, try and actually finish it this year.
